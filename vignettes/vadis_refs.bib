  abstract = {Using various methods derived from evolutionary biology, including maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, we tackle the question of the relationships among a group of Papuan isolate languages that have hitherto resisted accepted attempts at demonstration of interrelatedness. Instead of using existing vocabulary-based methods, which cannot be applied to these languages due to the paucity of shared lexemes, we created a database of STRUCTURAL FEATURES--abstract phonological and grammatical features apart from their form. The methods are first tested on the closely related Oceanic languages spoken in the same region as the Papuan languages in question. We find that using biological methods on structural features can recapitulate the results of the comparative method tree for the Oceanic languages, thus showing that structural features can be a valid way of extracting linguistic history. Application of the same methods to the otherwise unrelatable Papuan languages is therefore likely to be similarly valid. Because languages that have been in contact for protracted periods may also converge, we outline additional methods for distinguishing convergence from inherited relatedness.},

  doi = {10/dxf6xf},
  abstract = {Several test statistics are proposed for the purpose of assessing the goodness of fit of the multiple logistic regression model. The test statistics are obtained by applying a chi-square test for a contingency table in which the expected frequencies are determined using two different grouping strategies and two different sets of distributional assumptions. The null distributions of these statistics are examined by applying the theory for chi-square tests of Moore Spruill (1975) and through computer simulations. All statistics are shown to have a chi-square distribution or a distribution which can be well approximated by a chi-square. The degrees of freedom are shown to depend on the particular statistic and the distributional assumptions. The power of each of the proposed statistics is examined for the normal, linear, and exponential alternative models using computer simulations.},
